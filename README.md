# Weatherapp_beta
Tells the weather forecast of your current city using data from the 'dark-sky API'. Has a home page that tells you weather for the current item(first img) and a second page that tells you the forecast for the whole day(second img). 
The knowledge needed to build this was taken from a wonderful treehouse course about android development. 
Also, currently trying to add location control to give databased on inputted location instead of a hardcoded one.
